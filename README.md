Group Project 3, WDI7 General Assembly

* idea is to track github users over time, similar to how github tracks repositories over time.
* using the github api, we plan to aggregate and analyze user information over a set time interval
* Example analytics we plan to track include:
  1. aggregate use of languages
  2. number of commits per repo
  3. number of lines per commits
  4. average length of commit message
  5. number of forks vs owned repos
  6. additions/deletions over time
* Users will be able to favorite or star github accounts they want to keep tabs on
